This is me typing without drinking. Again for the second day, I wanted to be back. Trying to make it a habbit to post code onto Github and be active here and there.
It was a busy day at work. Coming from a CS background I love writting code in python and enjoy shell scripting. You know who I am now, a systems engineer!
